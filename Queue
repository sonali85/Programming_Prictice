#Implementing queue is a bit different. Queue works on the principle of “First-in, first-out”.
# Time plays an important factor here. We saw that during the implementation of stack we used append()
# and pop() function which was efficient and fast because we inserted and popped elements from the
# end of the list, but in queue when insertion and pops are made from the beginning of the list,
# it is slow. This occurs due to the properties of list, which is fast at the end operations
# but slow at the beginning operations, as all other elements have to be shifted one by one.
# So, we prefer the use of collections.deque over list, which was specially designed to have
# fast appends and pops from both the front and back end.

form collections import deque
list = deque([2,3,4,5])
list.append(3)
print(list)
list.popleft(list)
